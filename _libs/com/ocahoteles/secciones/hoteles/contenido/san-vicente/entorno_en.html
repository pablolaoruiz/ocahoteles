<p><strong>O salnés</strong></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Our hotel is located at the center of O Salnés region. At the heart of the Galician Rías Baixas is where you can find that region, which has countless resources, a vast range of activities and all you can wish to find. These are the perfect holidays for a demanding tourist. Its landscape and economy are defined by the geography, in which we must highlight two elements: on one side, the valley, surrounded by hills and crossed by the Umia River; on the other, the Arousa estuary, which provides a fishing atmosphere to the region. </p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>The name of the region itself derives from the fishing activity of the area, since it refers to the act of salting that was made here since ancient times; it was already mentioned in a document in the VI century. Nine of the town halls that form the region are: </p>
<p>Cambados, O Grove, A Illa de Arousa, Meaño, Meis, Ribadumia, Sanxenxo, Vilagarcía de Arousa, and Vilanova de Arousa; thanks to this, we can have a fishing Salnés, a farming one, a rural or urban one, a cultural one, a touristic one, a fun-loving one, a calm one… To touch, see and feel is possible here thanks to its nature and beaches, its monuments, cuisine, facilities, history, leisure and sports activities, hospitality…</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>All this varied offer is at your disposal in a matter of minutes. You can go from the mountain to the coast and its beaches in the blink of an eye. You can become filled with its culture thanks to the monuments, writers and artists and then, at night, you can go out and have another kind of fun. This is not a place only for Summer; thanks to its mild and humid oceanic climate, we do not have extreme temperatures during winter (minimum temperature of 10ºC between December and February) nor during Summer (maximum temperature of 30ºC during July and August), which makes it the perfect place throughout the year. Apart from its coast and beaches, another interesting option is its cuisine, a extremely delicious one, which is at our disposal at any time.</p>
