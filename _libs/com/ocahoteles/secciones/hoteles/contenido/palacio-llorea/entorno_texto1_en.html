<p>Oca Palacio de la Llorea Hotel**** is located only 7 km away from Gijón, the various beaches in the area, and in La Llorea Golf Course. Its closeness to the <em>Autovía del Cantábrico (A-8)</em> makes possible to travel long distances in a matter of a few minutes.</p>
<p>Even though it is the most populated city in the Principality of Asturias, Gijón still preserves its rural spirit; nature is only 5 minutes away from the city. The remains and traditional forms of the rural world can still be appreciated in the close relationship between nature and the inhabitants of Gijón. </p>
<p>What is more, the sea is very present in the geography of the area; you can find beaches like San Lorenzo, Poniente, Arbeyal, de los Mayanes, del Cervigón, de Peñarrubia, de Serín, la Cagonera, Estaño or the espectacular Ñora beach.</p><br>
<h3>Senda de la Ñora</h3>
<br><p>Starting from the golf course of Palacio de la Llorea, you can also take the Senda de la Ñora, which ends at Playa de la Ñora along the green landscapes of the riverbank of the stream of the same name.</p><br>
