<h3><strong>Why Vigo</strong></h3>
<p>There are a thousand reasons why the <strong>city of Vigo</strong> is a unique tourist destination in Spain. Although it is still young in matters related to the traditional circuit of holiday tourism, conference tourism and travel incentive, Vigo has all the characteristics needed to strengthen its position as a vital point of tourism in Galicia:</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><strong> •	Exceptional location: </strong>its geographical situation gives to Vigo a strategic role in the north-east tourism of Spain and its transport infrastructures turn it into the axis of the euro-region of North-Galicia and Portugal. </p>
<p><strong> •	Business city: </strong>Vigo is the biggest city in Galicia, its economic engine, and the urban area of the <em>Rías Baixas</em>, one of the touristic destinations that has grown the most during the lasts year and which has great recognition both at a national and international level. International trade fairs are organised in Vigo, such as Conxemar, Navalia or the Motor Show, among others. </p>
<p><strong> •	Modern Infrastructures:</strong> to the innate charm and its numerous means of communication, we must add the own touristic infrastructure of the city. There is plenty of accommodation of all categories and styles, and oriented to all kinds of guests, from urban to rural. The city also has excellent sociocultura spaces, from museums to event halls. </p>
<p><strong> •	National and International Connections: </strong>Vigo and Madrid have always had a close relationship both in terms of economy and culture. Both cities are linked by planes, trains and exemplary roads. But Vigo, thanks to its emblematic Peinador Airport, is an open city and it has connections with the main Spanish capitals, such as Barcelona, Seville or Bilbao, and also with the rest of Europe.</p>
<p><strong> •	Mild Climate:</strong> the microclimate in Vigo is an exception in Galicia, and quite probably in Spain. Even though it is located in the north, it is one of the clearest cities in the country. Vigo is in a transition of mediterranean and oceanic climate with gentle temperatures, the average summer temperature is 25ºC and during winter it will not be lower than 6ºC. </p>
<p><strong> •	For any Budget:</strong> it is possible to enjoy accommodation, the fabulous cuisine or leisure under any kind of budget you may have. There are luxury plans for the sybaritic and also plans within reach for those who travel with family or for the youngsters.</p>
<p><strong> •	Big but travel-friendly:</strong> its 300.000 inhabitants and its 110km2 make it the biggest city in Galicia although you do not have to sacrifice comfort to enjoy it every day. Cosy, flexible, and travel-friendly; Vigo is a must-visit city but, more importantly, a city where you can live. </p>
<p><strong> •	Safe City:</strong> the rates of criminality are lower than the average of the Spanish cities with more than 150.000 inhabitants, and that is what our visitors perceive. The rate continues lowering, during the last year a 33%. This is shown in the lively streets and in an intense but safe nightlife. </p>
<p><strong> •	Unspoilt Nature:</strong> in spite of big a big industrial city, Vigo has a practically virgin landscape, with big forest parks, hiking routes, a section of the Portuguese Camino de Santiago by the coast, and unique natural spaces like the Cíes Islands, in the Atlantic Islands of Galicia National Park. </p>
<p><strong> •	Coast City:</strong> the spectacular estuary in Vigo, the southernmost and with the deepest waters in the <em>Rías Baixas</em>, is the vital element of the city. Travelers can enjoy its splendid views from nearly anywhere in Vigo and lay down on any of their long sand beaches to admire the stunning Atlantic horizon.</p>
