<p>This is the greatest creation of Galicia for the world and vice versa, because what you can find within <strong>Santiago de Compostela</strong> cannot be explained without what come from abroad: designated a <strong>UNESCO World Heritage Site</strong> both the city and the <strong>Camino de Santiago</strong>, first route to be designated as <strong>European Cultural Itinerary</strong>. If it did not exist, it would be necessary to invent it. The granite is the material that contains life in the city chosen by the rain. The population centre has nearly a hundred thousand inhabitants, many of them are the <strong>university students</strong>, and it is visited by more than three million visitors per year. Its main touristic areas can be found in the<strong>circuit surrounding the Cathedral</strong> and its squares. The Praza do Obradoiro always amazes people for its wideness. Before entering the Cathedral you should stop at the square made by the Baroque front of the Cathedral itself and, at one side of the staircase, the <strong>Pazo de Xelmírez</strong>. To the north, there is the Plateresque front of the Hostal dos Reis Católicos, founded as a pilgrim hospital; to the west, there is the Neoclassical building of Pazo de Raxoi, currently a Town Hall; to the south, the Colexio de San Xerome, headquarters of the Rector, pointing to the Obradoiro its well preserved Medieval door, and adjacent to the Pazo de Fonseca, which has an entrance through the square holding the same name. Inside the Cathedral, you cannot miss the <strong>Pórtico da Gloria</strong>, the work of a renowned Romanesque, Master Mateo, and the traditional pilgrimage rituals. </p>
<p>Another wide open area is the <strong>Praza da Quintana</strong>, with two different heights linked by a staircase. On the highest level, or <strong>Quintana dos Vivos</strong>, the <strong>Casa da Parra</strong> stands out. On the lower and more extensive, or Quintana dos Mortos, the Casa da Conga. The impenetrable front of barred windows and the bench belongs to the <strong>Mosteiro de San Paio de Antealtares</strong>. At the entrance of the Cathedral you will see the <strong>Porta Santa</strong>, opened only in <strong>Jubilee Year</strong>. </p>
<p>The side doors of the Cathedral are in the Praza de Praterías, with the Romanesque front and the Torre do Reloxo or Berenguela. The area is completed with a staircase, the Fuente de los caballos and the narrow Casa do Cabido. </p>
<p>On the other side, in the Praza da Acibecharía it is worth mention the Mosteiro de San Martiño Pinario and everything inside its vast extension. </p>
<p><strong>Santiago de Compostela </strong>does not end on the surroundings of the Cathedral. The lively streets of the historic centre allow us to discover fascinating stone spots like the Praza do Toural, leaded by the <strong>Granell Museum</strong> in the Pazo de Bendaña; or the square and <strong>Arco de Mazarelos</strong>. Going down on this direction, a little bit farther away, we will arrive to the <strong>Colexiata do Sar</strong>, a Romanesque building with impressive buttresses. </p>
<p>Other historic doors of the Medieval borough are the Porta Faxeira, located on the <strong>big park of the Alameda</strong> with the <strong>Paseo da Ferradura </strong>where we can admire, with or without rain, the most pleasant view of the <strong>Obradoiro</strong>. And the Porta do Camiño in the surroundings of San Domingos de Bonaval with the monastery, Panteón de Galegos Ilustres, and the Museo do Pobo Galego where we will also find a splendid park and the Centro Galego de Arte Contemporánea, one of the arquitectonic prime examples of Modern Compostela.</p>
