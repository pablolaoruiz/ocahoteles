<p><strong>Oca Casas Reales </strong>is located on the center of <strong>Santiago de Compostela</strong>, cultural jewel of Galicia and meeting point of all pilgrims who finish the Camino. Being so close to the <strong>Cathedral</strong> and to the <strong>mercado de Abastos</strong>, we are the perfect place to get to know the city from its historic center.</p>
<p>Both this duplex-apartment and its twin are two excellent choices to discover Santiago. On the first floor it has a small room where you can store your luggage, a bathroom, a full equipped kitchen and a big living room with two large windows to the <strong>Casas Reais Street</strong> and the marvellous <strong>Salvador Parga Square</strong>. On the highest floor it has a big room with velux rooflight. </p>
<p>The <strong>Casas Reais Street </strong>is a few meters away from the main transportation network of the historic city: the <strong>Rúa da Virxe da Cerca</strong>, used by most of public buses. A few meters farther on there is parking lot, close to the Bonaval park. There are also parking areas in the adjacent streets, although not in Casas Reais because it is a pedestrian precinct. In spite of it, taxis can get you to the door of the house. Forget the car and public transport. You will be 4 minutes away walking from the <strong>Cathedral</strong>. The building is surrounded by lovely cafeterias and a step away from restaurants and fashionable bars. The street is the entrance to the French Way, so there is always an international atmosphere. On the same street, a bit farther on, there is a chemist&rsquo;s shop, several banks with cash dispenser, pubs, food and clothing stores… Less than five minutes away you can go shopping for food to <strong>the market of Santiago </strong>and get the fresh fish and seafood, fruits, vegetables and all kinds of meat from Spain. </p>
