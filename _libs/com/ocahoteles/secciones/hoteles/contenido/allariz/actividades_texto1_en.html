<h2>HOLIDAYS </h2>
<h3>FESTA DO BOI coincides with the feast of Corpus Christi </h3>
<p> In the fourteenth century a respectable Jewish population lived in Allariz, confined in the neighborhood of <B> Santo Estevo </b>, outside the walls, which lived conjugated an undeniable economic dynamism with the harassment caused by "official" Christianity, who lived in the walled city. <br> <br> The Corpus Christi party arrived, and taking advantage of the fact that the procession of the Blessed Sacrament needed to leave to approach the convent, it was when the Jews took advantage to evade their anger and frustration, shouting and insulting the passage of the procession. <br> <br> They tell the chroniclers that Xan de Arzúa, an alarico noble of deep religious convictions, decided to put an end to this situation. The procession of 1317 mounted on the back of a bull and accompanied by several servants and loaded with sacks with ants led by the procession of Corpus. When the Jews seemed to boycott the act, the base of the horns and the rain of ants shook the Jews forever. <br> <br> From then until 1936, every year for the Corpus came the Boi in Allariz. During the war it was suspended, until in 1983, a group of young people decides to recover the party, and the Boi runs again in Allariz, and with it a municipality with pride in its history and its traditions. </P> <br>
