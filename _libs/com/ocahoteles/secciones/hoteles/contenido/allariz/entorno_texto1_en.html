<h3>ALLARIZ</h3> 
<p><strong>Allariz</strong>, located in the <strong>province of Ourense</strong>, is a medieval jewel mounted on a backwater of the <strong>Arnoia river</strong>, that has managed to carefully maintain its legacy. It is named after the Suevian King Alaric, who repopulated these lands around the VI century, becoming during different occasions the Capital of the Kingdom of Galicia and seat of the Castilian Court during the course of the Middle Ages.</p>
<p>To accommodate the <strong>Literary Court</strong> and to obtain the title of &ldquo;<strong>Chave do Reino de Galicia</strong>&rdquo; (&ldquo;Key of the Kingdom of Galicia&rdquo;) are some of the honors received by the region of Allariz, whose splendour diminished over the centuries. Nevertheless, the legacy from that age remains pure in <strong>Allariz</strong>, a pioneer in interventions of heritage conservation and restoration, awarded with the European Urban and Regional Planning Award and included in UN Catalogue of Best Practices and in <strong>Biosphere Reserve in 2005</strong>. </p>
<p>Town&rsquo;s personality is manifested with every step we take through <strong>Allariz</strong>, a perfect mixture between religious, military and civil architecture, surrounded by the beauty of the landscape of the recovered <strong>Arnoia river bank</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Interesting Places:</strong></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p><strong>Jewish quarter</strong>: during the XIII century, they settled outside the city, in Socastelo&rsquo;s neighbourhood. </p>
<p><strong>Campo da Barreira</strong>: wide open space bounded on the north by the town wall. A marvelous Baroque fountain decorates its center while the <strong>Royal Convent of Santa Clara</strong>, founded in 1268 by the wife of King Alfonso X &ldquo;The Wise&rdquo;, leans out of one of its sides. This building has the biggest cloister in Spain and accommodates the ivory Virxe of Abrideira. The Church of San Benito can also be found in this area, where we can admire its lantern and magnificent belfry. </p>
<p><strong>Iconographic museum &ldquo;Aser Seara&rdquo;</strong>: located in Castelao Street. It has a wonderful collection of sacred art with Romanesque, Gothic and Baroque images. </p>
<p><strong>Home-Museum Vicente Risco</strong>: situated in <strong>San Lourenzo Street</strong>, where you can find the library and the study of the distinguished Galician writer. Here, people can observe his various drawings, documents and personal items.</p>
<p><strong>Bridge and Santa María de Vilanova Church</strong>: both constructions originated in the XII century. This Romanesque combination creates a beautiful view that awaits at the end of the Arnado trail.</p>
<p><strong>Penedo da Vela and Castle</strong>: it is the place where the missing castle of the town was once. From here, we can appreciate the panoramic view of the town and its surroundings, among them we can find <strong>the Church of Santiago</strong>, <strong>the Palace</strong> <strong>of the Court</strong> and the<strong> House-Tower of Castro Oxea</strong>. Towards the south, it can also be seen <strong>the Church of San Pedro</strong> and, towards the east, <strong>the Church of San Esteban</strong>..</p>
