<p><strong>Maragogi</strong>, located on the<strong> state of Alagoas</strong>, northeast region of Brazil, is known as the &ldquo;Costa dos Corais&rdquo;. This state is halfway between the cities of <strong>Recife and Maceió</strong>. It is the second most important touristic city of the state, after the capital (Maceió), and in tourism we find its main source of income.

<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>Originally, <strong>Maragogi</strong> was a fishing village known as <strong>Gamela</strong>, that belonged to the municipality of <strong>Porto Calvo</strong>, whose main resource was fishing and agriculture, especially the sugar cane. </p>
<p>The village of <strong>Maragogi</strong> was very active during the fights against the Dutch during the XVII century. There was heavy fighting in the<strong> Praia de Barra Grande</strong> and in the <strong>Praia de</strong> <strong>São Bento</strong>, during the advance of the invaders from <strong>Recife city towards Porto Calvo</strong>. Afterwards, during the XIX century, in 1832, also took place the Guerra dos Cabanos, that would last three years. </p>
<p>In the year 1875 the village became a town and changed its name to &ldquo;Isabel&rdquo;, in honour of the princess who freed the African-American people of slavery. A few years later, in 1982, the town became a city and its named changed again to &ldquo;<strong>Maragogi</strong>&rdquo;, after the river that flows by the city and thought to mean &ldquo;river of the Marauba tribes&rdquo; according to some historians. </p>
