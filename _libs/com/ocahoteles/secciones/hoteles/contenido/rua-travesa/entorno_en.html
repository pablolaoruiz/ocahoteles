    This city, due to its monumental integrity, brings together specific and universal values ​​in an ideal city that overflows both history and timelessness. </P>

    <b> Duerming Rua Travesa </b> is located in a privileged area of ​​the old part of the Galician capital, just a step away from the spectacular <b> Plaza de Abastos </b>. This place, of cultural, gastronomic and architectural interest, concentrates the activity of the market of the city where you can enjoy a glass of wine accompanied by an octopus tapa to the rhythm of improvised music by people who come to the place. Along with this, there are also the fixed positions of the booths that sell the best products with the highest quality. </p>
<p> <b> The Cathedral </b>, along with the four squares that surround it - <b> Obradoiro, Quintana, Immaculate and Praterías </b> - and the main historic streets, are a 2-minute walk from the hotel. </p>
