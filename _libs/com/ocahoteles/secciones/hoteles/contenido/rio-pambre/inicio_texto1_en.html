<p>45 minutes away from Santiago, 20 minutes away from Lugo and 50 minutes away from A Coruña, in the middle of the <strong>Ulloa region</strong>, you can find our cosy <strong>Spa</strong>, in a 5 hectares area crossed by the <strong>Pambre River</strong> and surrounded by native forests with centenary trees, very close to the <strong>Castle of Pambre</strong>. Bathed by the crystal clear and lively waters of the Pambre River, our spa was built following bioclimatic criteria, using characteristic materials from the Galician architecture such as stones, wood and slate. It is a temple of relax and enjoyment of nature. </p>
