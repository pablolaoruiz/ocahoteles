<h3><strong>History of the Spa</strong></h3>
<p>Enjoy our <strong>Spa</strong> and free yourself from worries. Our spa is built on the proximity of the ancient spa that was <strong>founded during the middle of the XIX century</strong>, and shortly after it already possessed an excellent prestige that expanded beyond the frontiers of Galicia. For a long time, the curative virtues of its sulphur water attracted visitors from different places in Spain, Portugal and even in France. </p>
<p>The place, although modest, appeared due to its own merits between the most <strong>famous Galician Spas</strong>. The ruins of the old Spa are preserved close to the <strong>modern facilities</strong> as a proof of a tradition that currently intending to recover and improve by using XXI century resources. </p>

<h3><strong>Therapeutic waters</strong></h3>
<p>The original temperature of the outgoing <strong>water from the hot spring is 17&rsquo;8ºC</strong>. The waters that  flow are bicarbonate, sulphide and sodium-rich. </p>
<p><strong>Bicarbonate Waters</strong></p>
<p>Waters rich in bicarbonate stimulate the enzyme-pancreatic secretion, increase the saponification power of the bile, and alkalize the urine and the gastric pH. </p>
<p><strong>Sulphide Waters</strong></p>
<p>These waters are recommended in reumatologic, dermatologic and respiratory processes.</p>
<p><strong>Sodium-rich Waters</strong></p>
<p>Lastly, these waters are recommended in gastric processes that present hyperacidity. </p>

<p><strong>Jet</strong></p>
<p>Application of one single jet by using moderate pressure and hot water in order to get a relaxing effect and to relieve stress. The effects achieved with this technique under more pressure are stimulation and toning of the skin. With the contrast of the final cold water jet, we achieve an improvement in our circulatory system.</p>
<p><strong>Inhalation</strong></p>
<p>It consists on directly applying over the respiratory tract medicinal mineral water in the form of steam. The system used is based on the release of a air stream over certain volume of medicinal mineral water, creating water vapour which is led through a tube and released on the nostrils and mouth by using a mask. This technique allows a deep cleaning of the respiratory tract. </p>
