<p><strong>Cuisine</strong></p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>Galicia is a community well known for the quality of its product, both the ones gotten at the sea and the ones that come from the land. At Oca Puerta del Camino you will be able to enjoy local cuisine but, if what you want is to <em>tapear</em> while visiting the city, we can recommend you the following areas:</p>
<p> •	Rúa do Franco: a street in the historical area, very well known for its wines and <em>tapas</em>. It goes from the Alameda until Obradoiro Square.</p>
<p> •	Market: here you can buy all kinds of products; both land products from the near vegetables gardens and seafood from the Galician estuary. In the closest streets  you can find nice places to <em>tapear</em> and taste some of these products.</p>
<p> •	Rúa de San Pedro / Casas Reais: it is the entrance to the historic area of the French Way, where you can also find restaurants and pubs to begin the night tour. </p>
