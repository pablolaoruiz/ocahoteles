<p><strong>Oca Santo Domingo Plaza</strong> is located only 5 minutes walk away from the <strong>historic district of Oviedo</strong>, a city with a rich cultural and artistic heritage. The Cathedral of Oviedo and the Cámara Santa (declared UNESCO World Heritage Site), the <strong>Campoamor Theatre</strong> or the <strong>Fontán Square</strong> are only a few of the most emblematic places in the historic district of the city. To these we must add institutional centers and other points of touristic interest which create a cultural net that narrates the life and history of Oviedo. </p>
<p>Enjoy a walk through the <strong>pedestrian streets</strong> of the busy commercial area, taste sidra in an Andalusian-like patio surrounded by colourful balconies and eat a bit of our delicious<strong> Asturian cuisine</strong>. </p>
