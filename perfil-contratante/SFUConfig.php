/*    Allowed Extensions    */

treated with attributes.. for example the attribute image will take pictures and
display them in HTML's img tag, some files may be risky to upload so you can set the
attribute 'exec' so they will be renamed into txt files so they wont be excuted ..
to disable an allowed extension simple add a hash before it like:
#$allowed['exec'][] = 'asp';
to add new extensions just add them with the attribute you want in the pattern:
$allowed['ATTRIBUTE'][] = 'EXTENSION';
            WITH OUT A DOT!

# =====================#
/*-image:   will treat file as an image and will be displayed if allowed!
  -text :   these files will not be touched at all and their contents wont be checked, so
            becareful when you use this one.
  -exec :   these files (like php, asp, cgi ..etc) may contain harmful codes
            that may harm your server so their content will be converted into safe-plain text
            and saved into a new .txt file.
  -package: this attribute allows you to upload files like zip, rar, exe and files which do not
            belong to previous attributes.. before, files like zip could be uploaded with
            the text attribut but you had to disable "view uploaded files" so you don't see
            weird results! now with this attribute the file wont be displayed even if you
            enabled "view uploaded file".*/
